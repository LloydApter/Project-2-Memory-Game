## Background

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. It required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To see the main work on the project, open `js/app.js` and checkout the app's functionality


## Description

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
